Read Me for Blasteroids:

Functionality that the game implements:

Initial bombs fall one at a time from an array of 50, once 50 bombs fall the game is won
The bombs don't change colour when they're hit
The laser works and is fully functional
The splitters do work, and they occur 10% of the time
The nuclear bomb works after ten bombs are destroyed, and the background does change colour, user is notified when they have a bomb
When either the initial bombs or splitters hit the ground the game is stopped and a message is sent to the user
There is a score for the user displayed on screen
Files have doc headers and comments
Did not manage to implement buffer graphics, wasn't really sure how to do so
Overall the game works and can be played

Playability

The game is fully functional but it seems like the "hit" calculator is a bit laggy and sometimes it takes too many clicks for the bomb to be destroyed, other times it's right away.
So it's a complete game, just too laggy.
