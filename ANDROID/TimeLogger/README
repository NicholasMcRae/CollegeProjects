This is the first Android app I built for our Android class in the 6th semester of CPA. The application itself is a basic timer.

When I was choosing the concept to build, I did so based on two criteria. The first was that it had a bit of complexity to it, 
and the second criteria was that I was confident that I could get it done before the project deadline while managing other projects.

On those two fronts I achieved what I set out to do and met the project specs.
