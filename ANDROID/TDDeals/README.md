TDDeals
=======

Second Android project for Fanshawe Mobile development course. Added to it's own repository as it's a partnered project and will
be coded collaboratively.

The app will use the Google Maps and Google Places API along with some sample TD financial data to create a customer experience
that locates service and merchandise deals set up by TD partnerships with other businesses.

The project scope is based on the 'TD Challenge' that was presented to our class by TD, however my partner and I turned
down the terms of the contest and are submitting the project only to our professor.
