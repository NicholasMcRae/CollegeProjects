In the sixth semester of CPA one of our courses mimicked project management using the Agile methodology. In a group of a few students we
were tasked with setting out some sprint goals, completing an app before term end, and then presenting the app at the end of the term.

This application is a health planner using a nutrition API and ASP.NET.
