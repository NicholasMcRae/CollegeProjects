CollegeProjects
===============

Some examples of the work I've done in the later semesters of Fanshawe CPA

C++ projects
============
FTP Client/Server
- Contains FTP client and server with mget and mput functionality for sending and receiving directories
- Client and server use socket library that was developed as a part of the application
- Completed in term 5

Threaded RGrep
- We were tasked with re-creating a project we did earlier in the program while including threading
- Turns out doing the project over a year later was quite a bit easier and more efficient
- Completed in term 4

Parallel Processing App
- In sixth term I built an application that leveraged the MPI standard to produce multi-processor functionality for parsing large data sets

C# projects
===========
Friend Tracker
- App created for Windows GUI course. We were allowed a creative project and I thought this concept would be neat
- The app allows a user to create records of their friends along with details and stories
- Completed in term 4

Molecular Weight Calculator
- We were tasked with creating a molecular weight calculator for our distributed programming with .NET course
- The idea was to create a component with an interface and a thin client that used the component objects
- Completed in term 5

Java projects
=============
Tiered App
- We were given a Java interface and were asked to flesh out its functionality with a MySQL back-end
- Completed in term 4

Applet Game
- Project specs had us create an applet game called Blasteroids that we could implement in a unique way
- Completed in term 4

Javascript project
==================
- Over the course of our web technologies course we produced an ASP web app in iterations which introduced us to Javascript programming in more detail
- Completed in term 5

Android project
===============
Time Logger
- Complete creative project
- Went through the Android app store looking for ideas that I thought I could implement before the deadline with limited time
- Ended up producing an app that can record the total time a user spends on different activities
- This app is 'project submission' ready, not 'sell' ready. To make it sellable it would need a few more months of work 
- Completed in term 6

TD Deals
- app developed for Fanshawe term 6 "TD Challenge"
- leverages Google Maps and Place APIs to produce customer-centric deals that are pinned to a map
