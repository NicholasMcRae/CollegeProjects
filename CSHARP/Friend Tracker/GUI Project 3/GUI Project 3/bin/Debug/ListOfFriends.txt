My brother had moved to Montreal with her and was working in the city. The summer after I graduated from teacher's college my brother came home for a week, and afterward I drove with him to Montreal to stay at their apartment for a few days. That's when I met Alana.
Alana takes budgeting and finances very seriously.
When I've been at my parents house, and Alana is visiting she likes to storm into my room in the morning and wake me up with a pillow.

We were roommates in fourth year of my university degree.
We used to get inebriated together quite often. I also made his cat chase a lazer around.
His cat used to sit on my desk and push things off with her paw and watch them fall.

I had a big crush on her when I was in high school.
I lived with her and two of her friends in university and when they came home from the bar they used to storm my room and jump on my bed and then run away.

Her parents are friends of my parents and so technically we met when we were very young. But when I moved back to Fanshawe to go to college she was also in the city and I ended up dating her for nine months, during first and second semester.  I ended up breaking up with her during the summer between second and third semester.
Likes to knit.
I took her to Toronto zoo last summer and we had a grand ole time.

She is the half-sister of my sister-in-law, Alana, who is married to my brother, Jamie. Her and I are closer in age and temperament than my sister-in-law and I and so we've gotten along quite well. We met at our siblings' wedding and have spoken on and off ever since.
She's rambunctious and witty.
The first time I ever met her she was sitting with her legs hanging off of a balcony wall at our hotel.
